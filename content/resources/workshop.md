## Understanding Quire Basics 

### The Command-Line Interface

**What is the command-line interface?**

A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to run program tasks. In it, the user issues commands in the form of typed strings of text. This is opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI) for a software program, in which the user controls the program through visualized buttons, toggles and menus. 

In Quire, the CLI enables you navigate your computer's files, as well as tell Quire what to do such as create, preview and output publications using simple commands like quire new, quire preview and quire build

**What are the benefits of using the command-line interface?**

The two main benefits of the command line is efficiency. Instead of spending time finding and clicking on individual files, you can use the CLI to perform actions on several files in one text command. Additionally, CLI applications often consume fewer network resources compared to graphical applications.

The command-line interface when it is first opened: ![command line shell](/img/screenshots/command-line-shell.jpg)

**Navigating with the CLI**


| Command       | Action   | Notes              |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| **`cd`** | Used to change project directories | You will use this command to navigate into your Quire project directory. Once you are in the directory you can run commands like `quire preview` and `quire build`. |
|  **`cd ..`** | Will take you back one directory level | This is especially useful if you keep multiple Quire projects as sub-directories within a main directory. |
| **`ls`** | Used to list all the files when in a project directory | This can be useful in making sure you are in the right folder. |
|  **`!!`** | This will re-run the last command you entered | |
