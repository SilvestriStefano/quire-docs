### The Command-Line Interface

**What is the command-line interface?**

A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to run program tasks. In it, the user issues commands in the form of typed strings of text. This is opposed to a graphical user interface (GUI) for a software program, in which the user controls the program through visualized buttons, toggles and menus. 

The command-line interface when it is first opened on a Mac computer: ![command line shell](/img/screenshots/command-line-shell.jpg)

**What are the benefits of using the command-line interface?**

The main benefit of the command line is efficiency. Instead of spending time finding and clicking on individual files, you can use the CLI to perform actions on several files with a single text command. Additionally, CLI applications often consume fewer network resources compared to graphical applications.

**Navigating with the CLI**

Use commands like `cd` ("change directory") and `ls` ("list") to navigate your computer's files: ![commandline vs folder](/img/screenshots/commandline-vs-folder.jpg)

#### Try it for Yourself

Mac: 

 1. Press Command-Spacebar to open Spotlight 
 2. Type "Terminal" (Mac's name for the CLI) and hit enter
 3. Type `ls`to list the contents of your computer's home directory
 4. Open your Finder
 5. Press Command-H and compare the files in that folder with what you see listed in the Terminal

PC: 

 1. Open the Start menu 
 2. Select Windows Powershell and hit enter
 3. Type `~` and hit enter to ensure you are in User and not Administrator mode.
 4. Type `ls` in Powershell to list the contents of your computer's home directory
 5. Click File Explorer
 6. Click the PC icon and compare the files in that folder with what you see listed in Powershell

 1. Choose a file you want to navigate into
 2. Type `cd` and the name of the chosen folder and hit enter

### Markdown 

**What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a text formatting standard that defines the use of very simple text character combinations in order to indicate structure and formatting that can easily be transferred to more complicated HTML (web markup). For example, something surrounded in asterisks in Markdown turns into italics in the final publication: *emphasis* = emphasis.

**What are the benefits of using Markdown?**

Markdown enables you to keep your publication's content in a non-proprietary plain-text format. No proprietary software is needed to open and access your files. That means should certain technology go obsolete, your content will remain stable and accessible. 

An alternative to Markdown is writing in HTML: 

```HTML
<h2>An Unordered HTML List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>  
```

In Markdown this would simply be: 

```Markdown
## An Unordered HTML List

- Coffee
- Tea
- Milk 
```

#### Try it Yourself

Mac:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to File and select "New File"
3. Type "Hi my name is [your name]" 
4. Type "Hi my name is [your name]" a second time and this time put two asterisks on either side of `**your name**`
4. Press Command-Shift-V to preview the HTML version 
5. Press Command-\ to create a split screen and drag one tab over to the right side to view a side-by-side comparison
