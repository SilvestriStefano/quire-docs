Quire is in a limited beta and not yet released as open-source software. For a free license to use Quire for your publication projects, and for additional access to support, [please sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKOJEq9ivhwizmdazjuhxBII-s-5SUsnerWmyF8VteeeRBhA/viewform)

Quire is centered around the static site generator, [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). Quire's command-line interface is written in JavaScript and requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

## Repositories

## Shortcodes API

### `q-class`

Used for styling. Wrapping any Markdown text in this shortcode will wrap it in a `<div>` with the given class name in the HTML output.

`{{</* q-class "" */>}}  {{</* /q-class */>}}`

| Positional Parameter[<sup>†</sup>](#positional) | Expected Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` (class name) | string | String without spaces or special characters to be used as a class for CSS styling. |

### `q-bibliography`

Generates a bibliography from the entries in the project's `bibliography.yml` file. See [*Citations & Bibliographies*](/documentation/citation-bibliographies/).

`{{</* q-bibliography sort="" */>}}`

| Parameter | Expected Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sort` | string | Optional. Value can be any string that matches a key in the entires under `entries` of the `references.yml` file, to indicate which key to alphabetically sort the output bibliography by. Without `sort` the default sort is on "full".  |

### `q-cite`

Adds a linked Author Date citation reference to the text, and a hover pop-up with the full citation text. It also adds the citation to a map of cited works, which can then be output as a page-level bibliography on essay and entry type pages. See [*Citations & Bibliographies*](/documentation/citation-bibliographies/).

`{{</* q-cite "" "" "" */>}}`

| Positional Parameter[<sup>†</sup>](#positional) | Expected Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` (author date reference) | string | Should exactly match an `id` value under `entries` in the `references.yml` file. Typically something like "Jones 1974". |
| `1` (page number) | string | Optional. A page number of the specific citation. Will be appended to the citation text with a text divider defined by `citationPageLocationDivider` in `config.yml` |
| `2` (display text)| string | Optional. Alternate text that should be displayed instead of the default Author Date provided in the first parameter. |

### `q-contributor`

Can be used to create a page of contributor biographies, a section of bios for a single page, a simple list of contributors, a byline for a particular page, or other similar outputs. See [*Contributors*](/documentation/contributors/).

`{{</* q-contributor range="" format="" align="" */>}}`

| Parameter | Expected Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| range | "page", "all", or string | Defines which contributors to include. An arbitrary value matching a contributor type such as "primary" or "secondary" may also be used. |
| format | "initials", "name", "name-title", "name-title-block", "bio" | Defines what format the list should take. |
| align | "left" (default), "center", "right" | Optional. Defines how the output text will be aligned. |

### `q-figure`

Inserts a formatted figure image, label, caption and credit line. If using a `data/figures.yml` file, only an `id` parameter is required for this shortcode. If other values supplied directly in the shortcode they will override any corresponding values in the `data/figures.yml`. See [*Figure Images*](/documentation/figure-images/) and [`figure_list`](#figure_list) above.

`{{</* q-figure id="" src="" label="" caption="" credit="" alt="" class="" */>}}`

| Parameter | Expected Value  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`id` | string | Spaces or special characters should not be used and will be stripped out. When used in a shortcode *without* a corresponding `src` parameter, the shortcode will look for a matching `id` in the project’s `data/figures.yml` file. When used in a shortcode *with* a corresponding `src` parameter, this will create an `id` for the image markup that can be used to link to the image directly (`mypublication.com/chapter01/#fig-3`) and ignores any  potentially corresponding information in the `data/figures.yml` file. |
| `src` | url | Should be the file name of a JPG, PNG or GIF image (`fig01.jpg`). Avoid using spaces or special characters, and if it’s in a sub-folder within the main `img` directory (which is defined by the `imageDir` parameter in the `config.yml` file), it should include that sub-folder name as well (`comparatives/fig01.jpg`). If your project uses `data/figures.yml` file, you shouldn’t use a `src` parameter in the shortcode as it will override all other information.  |
| `alt` | string | For accessibility, all images should have alternative text descriptions. ([Tips on crafting good alt text.](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)) Only ever leave blank if the image is purely decorative. |
| `caption` | string | The caption to appear below the figure. Special characters are allowed. Use Markdown for formatting. |
| `credit` | string | Follows the caption. Markdown allowed. |
| `label` | boolean | Default is set to `true`. `true` will add a label to the caption, such as "Figure 1.3", `false` will remove the label. The global label setting is in the `config.yml` file under the parameter `figureLabels`.  |
| `class` | `is-pulled-right`, `is-pulled-left`, `is-full-width`, `is-centered-small` | Sets the style of the figure image. |

### `q-figure-group`

Like `q-figure`, but with handling for multiple images at once. See [*Figure Images*](/documentation/figure-images/) and [`figure_list`](#figure_list) above.

`{{</* q-figure-group id=" , , " grid="" src="" label="" caption="" credit="" class="" */>}}`

| Parameter | Expected Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`id` | string | One or more comma-separated `id`s that match corresponding values in the project’s `data/figures.yml` file. |
| `caption` | string | The caption to appear below the figure group. Special characters are allowed. Use Markdown for formatting. Overrides any caption information provided in `data/figures.yml`. |
| `credit` | string | Follows the caption. Markdown allowed. Overrides any caption information provided in `data/figures.yml`. |
| `label` | boolean | Default is set to `true`. `true` will add a label to the caption, such as "Figure 1.3", `false` will remove the label. The global label setting is in the `config.yml` file under the parameter `figureLabels`. If a `caption` is also provided in the shortcode, the labels will be applied on their own directly under each image in the group, rather than as part of the caption. |
| `class` | `is-pulled-right`, `is-pulled-left`, `is-full-width`, `is-centered-small` | Sets the style of the group of figures overall. |
| `grid` |  `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` | Determines the horizontal width (in number of images) of the image grid. If no grid is set, the images will stack on top of one another vertically. |

### `q-figure-zoom`

Uses IIIF to add high resolution images with deep-zoom capabilities. See [*Zooming Images with IIIF*](/documentation/zooming-images/)

| Parameter | Expected Value  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | |

<div class="backmatter">
