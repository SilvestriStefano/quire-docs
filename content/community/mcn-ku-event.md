### Part 1: Introduction to Basic Concepts

**12:00–1:30 p.m.** 

**Erin Cecele Dunigan**, Quire Community Manager, and **Greg Albers**, Digital Publications Manager at Getty, will kick off the four-hour workshop by briefly introducing Quire and its benefits. The main focus will be introducing attendees to the basic concepts of how the tool functions, including learning to operate the command line, using a text editor to store content and images, and writing in Markdown and YAML.

### Part 2: Basic Concepts in Action

**2:00–4:00 p.m.** 

The latter half of the day will see these concepts put into practice, with attendees getting their very own Quire projects up and running, editing content, and making customizations. 

*Participants must bring their own laptop, and must complete the [Quire installation](/docs-v1/install-uninstall/) and setup requirements prior to the workshop. Details will be provided after registering. Questions can be sent to [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu).*
