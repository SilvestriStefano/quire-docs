*Following these sessions, MCN kicks off with its famous Ignite event, 5:00 p.m. at the nearby Abe and Jake's Landing. Paid conference registration required.*


### Part 1: Introduction to Basic Concepts

**12:00–1:30 p.m.** 

**Erin Cecele Dunigan**, Quire Community Manager, and **Greg Albers**, Digital Publications Manager at Getty, will kick off the four-hour workshop by briefly introducing Quire and its many benefits. Part 1 will focus on introducing attendees to the basic concepts of how the tool functions, including learning to operate the command line, using a text editor to store content and images, and writing in Markdown and YAML.

### Part 2: Basic Concepts in Action

**2:00–4:00 p.m.** 

The latter half of the day will see the concepts covered in Part 1 implemented. Attendees will be guided through setting up a new Quire project, editing content, and making customizations. The goal is for participants to get comfortable navigating the tool so they feel confident and empowered to continue working independently on their projects after the workshop.

*Participants must bring their own laptop and complete the necessary setup requirements before the workshop. Details will be provided after registering. Questions can be sent to [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu).*
