Developed by Getty, Quire is an open-source digital publishing tool that offers an elegant solution for creating dynamic publications in a variety of formats, including web, print, and e-book. In addition to being optimized for scholarly and visually rich publishing, Quire books are designed for longevity, sustainability, and discoverability.

Through the use of [static site generation](/about/how-it-works/) and plain text files, Quire makes it possible to preserve and distribute works in a stable and accessible format. Quire is flexible and feature-rich and can be used in its most basic configuration, or it can be customized, adapting to a  vast array of use cases. Individuals at all levels of technical experience can use Quire. Our rapidly growing [community](/community/community-showcase/) includes scholars, curators, editors, designers, web developers, and the digitally curious.

Quire builds upon Getty’s expertise in traditional book publishing and is the cornerstone of the institution’s pioneering [digital publishing program](https://www.getty.edu/publications/digital/index.html). Through the development of Quire, Getty is carving a path forward for individuals and institutions looking to solve the challenges of creating digital books that are not only as beautiful as the print books we know and love but are equally as enduring.
