The Quire team at Getty continues its work on Quire, including improving the installation process and overall architecture, in addition to ongoing enhancements for web accessibility. A number of specific features will be developed in conjunction with forthcoming Getty Publications’ books and released to the Quire community.

## Quire Features in Development

<div class="feature-list">

- **360º Images** Implements 360° rotating images as a standard feature for Quire publications.

- **Deep Linking** Implements functionality for deep linking to IIIF image regions and image annotation layers within a Quire publication.

- **Accordion Sections** Allows sections of primary content to be collapsed/expanded by a reader. Accordion sections are defined by an author using Quire markup short-codes and templates.

- **Catalogue Filters** Adds a set of HTML user interface elements to online Quire publications that allow a reader to update the objects displayed, showing only those that match the selected filter criteria. Catalogue filters will be based on the object meta-data fields defined in the objects.yml, and the display of filters will be configurable by authors.
