### Why are you replacing Hugo?

Hugo uses the Go templating language, which can be burdensome for developers to navigate. Eleventy (11ty) is a simpler and more powerful static site generator that is based on JavaScript. JavaScript is a more widely used language within the art, cultural heritage, and academic sectors we primarily work within. This move will enable the expansion of advanced features, a more robust set of CLI options for Quire, and improve developer support and contribution opportunities.
