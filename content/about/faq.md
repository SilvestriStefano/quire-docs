### What is Eleventy (11ty)?

Eleventy (11ty) is a simple yet powerful static site generator based on JavaScript. It was created as an alternative to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), our former static site generator. 11ty transforms a directory of varying types of templates into HTML. It is popular for its ability to mix multiple templating languages. It has been released as open source under the MIT License. Read more on the [11ty website](https://www.11ty.dev/).

### What are the benefits of 11ty?

11ty is light and flexible and has a significantly faster processing time. With the move to 11ty we have reworked the overall file structure of Quire projects to simplify navigation and make essential project files more accessible. On the development side of things, one of 11ty's great strengths is its ability to mix templating languages. For Quire projects, those are Liquid and JavaScript (more on those below). Above all, the move to 11ty will enable the expansion of advanced features, a more robust set of CLI options for Quire, and improve developer support and contribution opportunities.

### What is JavaScript?

Javascript is a popular text-based programming language that turns static web pages into dynamic, interactive sites, going a step beyond the capabilities of HTML and CSS. JavaScript can be found everywhere on the web, from refreshing a Twitter feed to your Amazon search bar or embedding Youtube videos. It is also widely used in the art, cultural heritage, and academic sectors. Learn more about JavaScript on the [Mozilla developer website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript).

### What is Liquid?

Liquid is an open-source templating language written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It was created by the e-commerce company [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) in 2006. It is the backbone of all Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on website storefronts. Read more about Liquid on the [Shopify.dev website](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid).

### What is Vite

[Vite (Vite.js)](https://vitejs.dev/) is a lightning fast tool for frontend development. It is replacing [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).  

### What is our timeline for transitioning to 11ty?

We expect the bulk of development work to be done by July 2022 with Quire's official open-source launch scheduled for the Fall. We look to the Quire community for feedback and to help us spot bugs that the transition may have generated. The move will be a gradual work in progress, and we appreciate our users' patience. Feel free to reach out with questions at [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu).  

### How does this affect older or in process Quire projects?

If you have older Quire projects that you foresee needing to update, we strongly recommend migrating them to 11ty. We will provide documentation and will also be available for support. While we will support the Hugo version of Quire for a short period of time, it will be gradually phased out in favor of 11ty. Older projects that do not need to be updated can be left alone.

Let us know if you will be starting any new Quire projects as early as June 2022. It will be advantageous to adopt the 11ty version of Quire early, even though our implementation will still be underway. We are happy to work closely with you to troubleshoot your use of Quire during this transition period. Reach out to us at [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu).

### Will there be new documentation?  

Yes, we will be writing new documentation for the 11ty version of Quire. The older Quire documentation will be gradually phased out over time. For the most part, changes to the docs will be fairly minor, especially on the content creator / editor side of things.

We are looking for contributions to help support the creation of developer-centric documentation. If you are interested in contributing please contact [quire@getty.edu](mailto:quire@getty.edu).

### Can I explore 11ty for myself?

We will have an 11ty branch of Quire available for people to play around with and offer feedback in the coming weeks. Please keep checking back for updates as we work out a few remaining bugs in the test branch.
