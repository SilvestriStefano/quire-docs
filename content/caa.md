### About Quire

With Quire, you can create enduring, discoverable, book-like publishing projects in a sustainable way. Quire is a digital publishing tool developed by [Getty](https://getty.edu). It is free to use and ideal for museums, universities, academic conferences, and journals looking to produce scholarly, highly illustrated publications.  While the website is the primary version, and can include features like high resolution zooming images, linked notes and glossaries, and embedded audio and video clips, Quire projects can also be output as PDFs, e-books, and even print-on-demand publications. Read our [*Implentation Considerations*](https://quire.getty.edu/documentation/implementation/) for more information or [view the Quire Fact Sheet](/downloads/quire-fact-sheet.pdf)
